# Optimizer search design

How the optimizer walks the mod-combination space without wasting
evaluations. Recorded 2026-07-24. Companion to
[`CORE.md`](CORE.md) §5 (objectives, constraints, engine-only principle)
and [`MECHANICS.md`](MECHANICS.md) §2–§3 (capacity/polarity, elemental
hierarchy).

## 1. Build equivalence — canonical form, never test twice

Damage output of a build depends on exactly two things:

1. **which mods** are equipped (a multiset), and
2. the **relative order of position-sensitive mods** — today that is
   only **elemental-primary mods**, because slot layout drives the
   combination hierarchy (MECHANICS §3). Everything else (crit, damage,
   multishot, status, dual-stats' non-element half, …) feeds order-free
   additive/multiplicative buckets.

Slot assignment and polarity layout are **not** part of a build's
damage identity — they affect only *legality* (capacity). Therefore:

**Canonical form** = the position-sensitive mods first, in their chosen
order (slots 1..k), followed by the remaining mods in a fixed sort (by
mod id). Two selections that differ only by permuting position-free
mods — or by where the polarized slots sit — are the **same build** and
must be evaluated once.

Search accordingly enumerates canonical forms directly:

- choose the **element order** (the only ordering degree of freedom),
- choose the **rest as an unordered set** (drain numbers are ignored at
  this stage — selection first, legality later),
- prune any candidate whose canonical form was already evaluated
  (cache keyed by canonical form + scenario + buff policy).

**Second-level dedup (cheap, pre-sim):** different element orders can
still resolve to the *same* combined-element damage vector (e.g.
swapping the two members of a single combining pair: Cold,Elec vs
Elec,Cold → the same Magnetic pool). Run the pure elemental-combination
layer (pipeline [2]) on each candidate — it is trivially cheap — and
dedup on the **resolved post-[2] vector** before any Monte Carlo.

Position-sensitivity notes:

- **Combined-element mods** (Magnetic Might family) sit outside the
  primary hierarchy (MECHANICS §3 rule 7) → position-free.
- **Innate elements** take their position by *rule* (last, or pulled
  forward by a same-element mod) — never a search dimension.
- **Buff-injected elements** (Frenzy's +100% Toxin) enter at their
  defined position — also not a search dimension.

## 2. Best-effort legalization — a filter, not a search dimension

Because legality never changes damage, it runs *after*
canonicalization and *before* evaluation, per candidate:

1. **Rearrange the innate polarity slots.** Innate polarities are a
   freely repositionable **pool** (`engine::mods::plan_forma` step 1):
   spend them on the biggest-drain matching mods.
2. **Spend Forma greedily** on the biggest-drain unmatched mod until
   the build fits the capacity cap (`plan_forma` step 2). Mismatched
   placement is never used — a blank slot is strictly better.
3. Still over cap fully forma'd → the candidate is **impossible** and
   is rejected (hard error, consistent with `validate_loadout`).

Forma count is not free in-game; later it can become a secondary
objective or constraint (e.g. "best build within 3 Forma") — but it
never affects the damage ranking of legal builds.

## 3. Conditional-effect policy — assumed-max by default

Stacking/triggered effects (Galvanized Diffusion's on-kill multishot
stacks, Galvanized Shot's CO stacks, Fevered Frenzy's 20, Frenzy's
headshot buff, …) evaluate under one of three policies:

1. **`assumed_max` (default):** every conditional buff at full
   stacks/100% uptime — the community "assume max stacks" convention. This is
   what today's `LockedBuff` mechanism in `engine::dummy` implements
   (Frenzy locked, Fevered Frenzy at 20); it generalizes to a
   per-buff map.
2. **`configured`:** explicit per-buff stack counts / uptimes (e.g.
   Galvanized Diffusion held at 2 stacks) for what-if comparisons.
3. **`emergent` (future):** no assumption — stacks rise and decay from
   the simulated timeline itself (kills grant, Galvanized decay drops
   one stack and resets duration, deaths clear), so sparse-kill
   scenarios price the Galvanized family honestly.

The policy is part of the evaluation cache key (§1), since it changes
results.

## 4. Evaluation

Canonical, legal candidates go to the engine scenario (CORE.md §5:
analytic expectation for coarse ranking, Monte Carlo for finals; the
optimizer never reimplements damage math). Results are cached by
(canonical form, scenario, policy); equivalent combinations are never
re-simulated.

## 5. Implementation status (2026-07-24)

Implemented in `optimizer/` (`wfsim-optimizer` binary):

- §1 canonical enumeration: 8-of-23 subsets with family exclusivity
  (155,727 subsets by the generating function — pinned by test), ×
  distinct-element-order permutations, second-level dedup on the
  resolved post-[2] vector (1,452,146 order variants → 391,789
  candidates, ~1 s).
- §2 legalization via `engine::mods::plan_forma` per subset.
- §3 `StackPolicy::AssumedMax` in `engine::loadout::resolve`.
- Constraint hooks (prescribed-mods presets): `require=<mod_id>` / `forbid=<mod_id>`
  CLI args filter the space before enumeration.
- Evaluation: **successive halving** across all cores — rounds of
  (runs, keep): 3→16384, 12→3072, 48→512, 200→64, 1000→24; early
  rounds rank by mean effective damage (continuous, low variance),
  the final rounds by mean kills (the objective). Deterministic
  per-candidate seeds.
- Benchmark scenario: Dual Toxocyst Incarnon (fixed evolutions, no
  arcanes) vs Thrax Centurion @9999 Steel Path, instant respawn, 100%
  headshots, 60 s, finals at 1000 runs.
- Resumable rounds: `run_funnel` takes `start_round` and an
  `on_checkpoint` sink, so a browser run that a page reload killed
  continues from the last COMPLETED round instead of the beginning.
  Seeds key off the ABSOLUTE round index, so the resumed run is not
  merely similar to the uninterrupted one — it is the same
  (`a_resumed_funnel_lands_on_the_same_leaderboard`). The screen resumes
  too, from a cut of the walk rather than a round boundary
  (`a_resumed_screen_lands_on_the_same_survivors`). See docs/WASM.md for
  the checkpoint format and what it deliberately does not cover.
- Best-so-far snapshots: the screen publishes its top slice every 4096
  candidates and every completed round publishes its leaderboard, both
  result-shaped. A browser cancel TERMINATES the worker, so a leaderboard
  that has not already left it cannot be recovered — this is what makes a
  cancelled run show its ranking instead of an empty page.

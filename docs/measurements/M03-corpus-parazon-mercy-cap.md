# M3 — Corpus Parazon Mercy cap ✅ (informal, 2026-07-24)

*Protocol and setup: [MEASUREMENTS.md](../MEASUREMENTS.md). Cross-references `M<n>` are files in this folder.*

**Question.** Does the Corpus Mercy cap reach 100% (Parazon page) or only
with shields removed (Impact page wording)?

**Result (in-game tests, 2026-07-24):**
1. Corpus units **do reach the 100% cap**.
2. **Shields are a hard gate**: at 1 HP behind 10,000 shields there is no
   Mercy prompt — "shields removed" is a prerequisite, not a bonus
   condition. Overguard likewise blocks Mercy entirely (also confirmed by
   the wiki Overguard patch history). Model updated: `can_mercy` requires
   shields = 0 and overguard = 0 before any window math.

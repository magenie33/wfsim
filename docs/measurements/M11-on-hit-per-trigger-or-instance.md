# M11 — Is an "on hit" perk judged per trigger pull or per damage instance? ✅ (informal, 2026-07-30)

*Protocol and setup: [MEASUREMENTS.md](../MEASUREMENTS.md). Cross-references `M<n>` are files in this folder.*

**Question.** Overwhelming Attrition reads "On Hit that is neither Critical
nor applies a Status Effect". Is that ONE evaluation per shot, or one per
damage instance the shot produces? The distinction decides what the perk is
worth on an AoE weapon, and it is the same question as whether a Laetum's
direct hit and its explosion each arm it.

**Result (in-game, user, 2026-07-30):** per **damage instance**, in both
directions the question could be asked.
1. **Across enemies:** fired into a crowd, a SINGLE Laetum shot takes the
   buff from empty to its 3-stack cap. One trigger pull cannot grant three
   stacks under a per-shot reading.
2. **On ONE enemy:** a single shot at a LONE target grants exactly **2
   stacks** — the direct hit and the explosion each arm it, and the count
   is the instance count, not the cap (3).

**Consequence for the model.** Result 2 is the load-bearing one and it is
direct, not inferred: two attack parts landing on the SAME enemy ARE two
instances. It also independently corroborates the verbatim AoE rules
(`Status_Effect`: each enemy hit gets its own status roll; Laetum: "Initial
hit and explosion apply status separately") from the perk side.

That is what `engine::dummy` implements — the trigger is evaluated inside the
attack-stage loop, so each stage judges its own crit and its own proc list.
Pinned by `the_explosion_arms_an_on_hit_buff_of_its_own`, which gives the
radial ZERO damage so the only thing it can contribute is the second arming.

**No residue.** Both readings are measured. Note the 2 (not 3) in result 2 is
itself informative: it rules out "any qualifying shot fills the buff" and
confirms the count tracks instances.

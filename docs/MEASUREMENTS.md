# wfsim — In-game Measurement Protocols

Golden tests need real measurements. Each protocol here is written so a
single session produces an unambiguous answer. Add results inline (date +
numbers), then flip the corresponding `verification.status` / MECHANICS.md
entry.

General setup:
- HUD: enable damage numbers (Enhanced Damage Numbers). Color code:
  **blue = damage to shields**, white = health, yellow/orange/red = crits.
  One number per damage instance; a hit that splits across pools shows the
  pool parts separately (blue vs white).
- Lab: the Simulacrum is fine as a *measurement lab* (mechanics are the real
  game's); our engine just doesn't model the Simulacrum's own toggles.
  Pause AI. Discard any yellow/orange (crit) readings unless the protocol
  says otherwise.

## M1 — Is Toxin's shield-bypass damage reduced by the enemy shield gate?

**Question.** When an enemy's shields break, a 0.1 s gate lets only 5% of
damage reach health. Toxin never touches shields — is its direct damage
gated inside that window, or does it pass in full?

**Model assumption (2026-07-24, user):** Toxin passes in **full** — it never
enters the shield pipeline, so the gate should not see it. Status:
**assumption / unverified** until this protocol is run.

**Primary method — kill-threshold discrimination (no recording, no number
reading).** Turn the transient into a persistent binary: pick a level where
target health `H` sits between the gated and ungated toxin damage,
`0.05·T < H ≤ T`. Then the breaking shot either kills on the spot (ungated)
or leaves the target standing (gated).

- **Target.** Corpus **Crewman** (no armor, Head 3.0x; base @L1: 90 HP /
  120 shields). Level ≈ **5** (≈115 HP / ≈148 shields — robust to ±20%
  formula error).
- **Weapons.** *Shield whittler*: any unmodded pure-IPS weapon (bare
  Braton) — IPS never touches health while shields are up. *Verdict shot*:
  **Lex + Pathogen Rounds** (+90% Toxin): panel 180 physical + `T` = 162
  Toxin.
- **Steps.**
  1. Whittle the shield bar visibly low (<20%, eyeball is fine) with body
     shots from the whittler.
  2. One **body** shot with the Lex (never the head — weakspots bypass the
     gate). The 180 physical certainly finishes the shield; the 162 Toxin
     lands the same instant.
  3. Outcome: **instant death** → Toxin ungated (assumption confirmed).
     **Survives the instant** → Toxin is gated (fix MECHANICS.md + engine).
  4. Repeat ≥5×. A crit on the verdict shot cannot flip the result
     (gated 0.05 × 324 ≈ 16 ≪ H). If a Toxin *proc* ticks afterwards
     (green DoT numbers), void that trial — the DoT could kill a
     should-survive target over 6 s.

**Alternative (needs reading numbers).** Same setup at a high level; read
the white (health-pool) damage number of the breaking shot: ≈`T` ungated,
≈`0.05·T` gated. Requires the recording setup below.

## Recording setup (for any number-reading protocol)

- **Recorder:** OBS Studio with **Replay Buffer** (hotkey saves the last
  1–2 min; one save per trial). GPU-vendor instant replay (NVIDIA App /
  AMD ReLive) as a lighter alternative; Xbox Game Bar (Win+Alt+G, last
  30 s, 60 fps) as the zero-install fallback.
- **Frame rate:** 60 fps = 6 frames inside a 0.1 s window (sufficient);
  120 fps preferred if the game holds 120+ (uncap the in-game FPS limit).
- **Quality:** hardware encoder (NVENC/AMF) at **CQP 15–18** or ≥50 Mbps,
  native resolution — the payload is small damage-number glyphs; artifacts
  make them unreadable.
- **In-game:** damage numbers = Enhanced; motion blur / screen shake off,
  particles low.
- **Playback:** frame-step in MPC-HC (Ctrl+→) or mpv (`.` / `,`).
- **Window-width probe (M1b):** high fire rate = shots per window:
  Twin Grakatas 20/s (~2 in-window), Soma 15/s (~1–2). Frame-step to count
  how many post-break body hits show 5%-sized white numbers before full
  numbers resume. Keep the M1 verdict shot itself on a slow weapon (Lex).

**Bonus readings from the same session:**
- The physical spill of the breaking shot (white part next to the blue
  break) should be ≈ 5% of the spill → confirms the 5% leak value.
- **M1b — window width:** switch to a high fire-rate weapon (≥10/s), spray
  the body through a shield break: count how many post-break shots show
  tiny (5%) white numbers → confirms the 0.1 s window.
- **M1c — weakspot bypass:** repeat step 2 aiming at the **head**: the
  post-break numbers should be full-value (×3 location) even in-window.

**Result:** _not yet run._

## M2 — Simulacrum "Steel Path" toggle: does it still boost armor?

**Question.** The toggle was introduced (U33.5) as "+250% Health, Armor,
and Shields", but U36 removed the armor bonus from Steel Path missions.
Does the Simulacrum toggle still touch armor?

**Sketch.** Armored target (e.g. Grineer Lancer) at a fixed level; compare
damage numbers of the same weapon with the toggle on/off; any change beyond
×(1/2.5) health scaling implies an armor change. (Only affects how we use
the Simulacrum as a lab — missions are authoritative for the engine.)

**Result:** _not yet run._

# wfsim — In-game Measurement Protocols

Golden tests need real measurements. Each protocol here is written so a
single session produces an unambiguous answer. Add results inline (date +
numbers), then CORRECT the data/docs in place (decision 2026-07-24: no
per-file verification status - the recorded value is always the current
belief).

General setup:
- HUD: enable damage numbers (Enhanced Damage Numbers). Color code:
  **blue = damage to shields**, white = health, yellow/orange/red = crits.
  One number per damage instance; a hit that splits across pools shows the
  pool parts separately (blue vs white).
- Lab: the Simulacrum is fine as a *measurement lab* (mechanics are the real
  game's); our engine just doesn't model the Simulacrum's own toggles.
  Pause AI. Discard any yellow/orange (crit) readings unless the protocol
  says otherwise.

## M1 — Is Toxin's shield-bypass damage reduced by the enemy shield gate?

**Question.** When an enemy's shields break, a 0.1 s gate lets only 5% of
damage reach health. Toxin never touches shields — is its direct damage
gated inside that window, or does it pass in full?

**Model assumption (2026-07-24; revised same day):** the gate is the
enemy analogue of the player shield-gate — a 0.1 s protection window on the
unit — so Toxin is **gated to 5% too**. Status: **assumption / unverified**
until this protocol is run. Outcome mapping: target **survives** the
verdict shot → assumption confirmed; **instant death** → Toxin is ungated,
revert MECHANICS.md §8 and the engine model.

**Primary method — kill-threshold discrimination (no recording, no number
reading).** Turn the transient into a persistent binary: pick a level where
target health `H` sits between the gated and ungated toxin damage,
`0.05·T < H ≤ T`. Then the breaking shot either kills on the spot (ungated)
or leaves the target standing (gated).

- **Target.** Corpus **Crewman** (no armor, Head 3.0x; base @L1: 90 HP /
  120 shields). Level ≈ **5** (≈115 HP / ≈148 shields — robust to ±20%
  formula error).
- **Weapons.** *Shield whittler*: any unmodded pure-IPS weapon (bare
  Braton) — IPS never touches health while shields are up. *Verdict shot*:
  **Lex + Pathogen Rounds** (+90% Toxin): panel 180 physical + `T` = 162
  Toxin.
- **Steps.**
  1. Whittle the shield bar visibly low (<20%, eyeball is fine) with body
     shots from the whittler.
  2. One **body** shot with the Lex (never the head — weakspots bypass the
     gate). The 180 physical certainly finishes the shield; the 162 Toxin
     lands the same instant.
  3. Outcome: **instant death** → Toxin ungated (assumption confirmed).
     **Survives the instant** → Toxin is gated (fix MECHANICS.md + engine).
  4. Repeat ≥5×. A crit on the verdict shot cannot flip the result
     (gated 0.05 × 324 ≈ 16 ≪ H). If a Toxin *proc* ticks afterwards
     (green DoT numbers), void that trial — the DoT could kill a
     should-survive target over 6 s.

**Alternative (needs reading numbers).** Same setup at a high level; read
the white (health-pool) damage number of the breaking shot: ≈`T` ungated,
≈`0.05·T` gated. Requires the recording setup below.

---

## Recording setup (for any number-reading protocol)

- **Recorder:** OBS Studio with **Replay Buffer** (hotkey saves the last
  1–2 min; one save per trial). GPU-vendor instant replay (NVIDIA App /
  AMD ReLive) as a lighter alternative; Xbox Game Bar (Win+Alt+G, last
  30 s, 60 fps) as the zero-install fallback.
- **Frame rate:** 60 fps = 6 frames inside a 0.1 s window (sufficient);
  120 fps preferred if the game holds 120+ (uncap the in-game FPS limit).
- **Quality:** hardware encoder (NVENC/AMF) at **CQP 15–18** or ≥50 Mbps,
  native resolution — the payload is small damage-number glyphs; artifacts
  make them unreadable.
- **In-game:** damage numbers = Enhanced; motion blur / screen shake off,
  particles low.
- **Playback:** frame-step in MPC-HC (Ctrl+→) or mpv (`.` / `,`).
- **Window-width probe (M1b):** high fire rate = shots per window:
  Twin Grakatas 20/s (~2 in-window), Soma 15/s (~1–2). Frame-step to count
  how many post-break body hits show 5%-sized white numbers before full
  numbers resume. Keep the M1 verdict shot itself on a slow weapon (Lex).

**Bonus readings from the same session:**
- The physical spill of the breaking shot (white part next to the blue
  break) should be ≈ 5% of the spill → confirms the 5% leak value.
- **M1b — window width:** switch to a high fire-rate weapon (≥10/s), spray
  the body through a shield break: count how many post-break shots show
  tiny (5%) white numbers → confirms the 0.1 s window.
- **M1c — weakspot bypass:** repeat step 2 aiming at the **head**: the
  post-break numbers should be full-value (×3 location) even in-window.

**Result:** _not yet run._

## M3 — Corpus Parazon Mercy cap ✅ (informal, 2026-07-24)

**Question.** Does the Corpus Mercy cap reach 100% (Parazon page) or only
with shields removed (Impact page wording)?

**Result (in-game tests, 2026-07-24):**
1. Corpus units **do reach the 100% cap**.
2. **Shields are a hard gate**: at 1 HP behind 10,000 shields there is no
   Mercy prompt — "shields removed" is a prerequisite, not a bonus
   condition. Overguard likewise blocks Mercy entirely (also confirmed by
   the wiki Overguard patch history). Model updated: `can_mercy` requires
   shields = 0 and overguard = 0 before any window math.

---

## M4 — Which health curve do Anarchs use? ✅ (2026-07-24)

**Question.** `Enemy_Level_Scaling` lists Anarchs in two health tabs with
different exponents: "Anarchs, Corrupted" (`0.015·Δ^2.1 / 10.7332·Δ^0.685`)
vs the "Murmur, Sentient, and Unaffiliated" tab whose *text* also names
Anarchs (`0.015·Δ^2 / 10.7332·Δ^0.5`). Engine currently follows the tab
structure (Anarchs = Corrupted curves).

**Method.** Read a plain (non-Eximus, non-Commandeered) Anarchs unit's HP
at a known level and compare (bases @L1: Anarch Arcus 100, Gladius 175):

| unit | level | A: Corrupted curves | B: Unaffiliated curves |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arcus | 50 | 5,415 | 3,702 |
| Arcus | 60 | 7,950 | 5,322 |
| Arcus | 100 | 25,088 | 10,779 |
| Gladius | 60 | 13,913 | 9,313 |
| Gladius | 100 | 43,905 | 18,864 |

A 2.3x gap at level 100 — a health-bar read or a shots-to-kill count
decides it.

**Result (2026-07-24):** **Anarchs = Corrupted curves.** The wiki's own
calculated stat block for Commandeered Ash Prime @L1000 (wiki calculator:
18,275,927.85 HP / 623,680.94 shields / 2,700 armor / 27,531 affinity)
matches our Corrupted health (2.1/0.685) and Corrupted shield (2.0/0.75)
curves **to the cent**; the Unaffiliated pair is 3.6x off. Bonus
confirmations: affinity = base 5,000 × (1 + 0.1425·√level) floored, with
the module's Affinity field being the base value. Pinned as a regression
test (`commandeered_ash_prime_at_1000_matches_wiki_calculator`). The
Murmur-tab text naming Anarchs is a wiki typo.

## M5 — Heat Inherit context sync is bidirectional ✅ (informal, 2026-07-24)

**Question.** The Heat singleton's first-proc modifier context (Heat% /
faction brackets): does a strong first proc also elevate later unmodded
contributions (the wiki left this direction unconfirmed)?

**Result (in-game, 2026-07-24):** **Yes — bidirectional.** The first proc's
brackets apply to every later contribution in both directions. Build
consequence: light the first Heat proc with the best-modded weapon; any
source can then feed the ramp at full value.

---

## M6 — Frozen exit semantics ✅ (informal, 2026-07-24)

**Question.** When Frozen (the 10th-Freeze-stack state) expires, are the
remaining 3 Cold stacks the surviving old ones (carried timers) or a
hard reset?

**Result (in-game, 2026-07-24):** **Hard reset**: Freeze is set to exactly
3 stacks with fresh 6 s timers; pre-Frozen stacks and timers are
irrelevant. Corollary: stack decay during Frozen is moot. Also observed:
the Freeze display stays pinned at 10 throughout Frozen, and Cold procs
are fully inert during it.

---

## M7 — Who owns the 3 fresh post-thaw Freeze stacks? ✅ (2026-07-24)

**Question.** After Frozen's hard reset (M6), the 3 fresh stacks get 6 s
timers — scaled by whose status-duration modifier? Normally each Freeze
stack's duration is `6 s × (1 + status duration)` of its proccing weapon.

**Setup.** Two Cold weapons: **D+** with heavy +status duration (e.g.
+100% → 12 s stacks) and **D0** with none (6 s). Paused target that can
be Frozen (non-boss, no Overguard).

**Trials** (time the 3 stacks' post-thaw lifetime with no further Cold):
1. 9 stacks from D0, the 10th (trigger) from **D+** → if stacks last
   ~12 s: attribution = trigger weapon (hypothesis B).
2. 9 stacks from D+, the 10th from **D0** → if ~12 s here instead,
   attribution = historical stacks (C); if both trials give ~6 s,
   attribution = nobody / flat base (A).
3. Cross-check: all 10 from D+ → A predicts ~6 s, B and C predict ~12 s.

**Result (in-game, 2026-07-24):** **Hypothesis B — the trigger.** The 3
fresh stacks use the status-duration modifier of the weapon that applied
the **10th** stack (the 9→10 proc). Model: the Frozen entity snapshots
its trigger's context and issues the reset stacks from it.

---

## M8 — Magnetic break-proc attribution with mixed appliers

**Question.** The shield/overguard-break Electricity proc scales with the
applier's mods (status-damage ×3.61 double-dip, faction double-dip,
literal Electricity mods). With stacks from MULTIPLE sources, whose mod
context does it read? Hypotheses: A first stack's applier (Heat Inherit
pattern), B last stack's applier (Frozen/M7 pattern), C the
shield-breaking hit's source, D per-stack attribution (each stack's 3%
chunk uses its own applier — suggested by the "per stack" wording).
Stakes: up to ~×8.7 between a modded and a bare applier.
**Prediction: D** (per-stack) — "per stack" wording, the Blast-radial
per-stack-snapshot precedent, and proc instances demonstrably carrying
source context; the counter-precedents (Heat first-proc, Frozen trigger)
both stem from special causes absent here.

**Method.** Magnetic weapons M+ (heavy status-damage + faction mods) and
M0 (bare); high-shield Corpus target. Read the post-break Electricity
tick numbers (6 s window):
1. All stacks M+, break with a non-magnetic weapon → applier baseline.
2. All stacks M0, break with M+ → big ticks = C; small = applier-owned.
3. Mixed 5×M+ then 5×M0, break with a third source → intermediate = D;
   all-M+ value = A; all-M0 value = B. Swap application order to
   separate A/B.

**Result:** _not yet run._

## M9 — Incarnon transition timings ✅ (2026-07-26)

**Question.** (a) Duration of the on-empty revert (fire the 270th round →
first base-form shot possible); (b) whether transition animations scale
with modded reload speed. Known: manual transmute-in = the weapon's
reload time (confirmed in-game).

**Method** (deterministic animation — 1 trial suffices, do 3): record at
60 fps, frame-step in PotPlayer (F/D).
1. **Calibrate the marker method** on a plain base-form reload: R-press →
   magazine UI refill frame; expect ≈141 frames (2.35 s unmodded).
2. **Manual switch-back** (alt-fire with charge left): transform-start
   frame → first base-form muzzle flash while SPAMMING fire (±50 ms click
   error acceptable). Secondary marker: the ammo UI swapping from the
   charge display back to 12/72 (record both; a mismatch is itself a
   finding).
3. **Empty revert**: 270th round's muzzle flash → same T1 markers.
4. Repeat all three with a large reload mod (Quickdraw +48% → predict
   1.59 s if animations scale with modded reload speed).
5. Cross-check timings against the audio track in Audacity (transform /
   reload sound onsets are ms-sharp edges).

**Outcome mapping**: revert ≈ 2.35 s → the 4.7 s pseudo-reload model
stands; ≈ 0 → pseudo-reload becomes 2.35 s; other → independent constant.
Scaling result updates `transition_animation_seconds` semantics.

**Result (in-game, 2026-07-26):** transmute-in = the weapon's reload time
(2.35 s unmodded); **revert-out has its own base of 1.0 s** (measured
exactly 1.3 s under −30% reload speed). Both directions scale with
reload-speed bonuses. Full cycle downtime = 2.35 + 1.0 = **3.35 s**
unmodded; the pseudo-reload model updated accordingly. Minor residue:
the exact scaling formula direction (time × (1+penalty) vs
base/(1+bonus)) — one more mod value would pin it.

---

## M10 — What does a reload-speed buff reach on an Incarnon weapon? ✅ (informal, 2026-07-30)

**Question.** Lethal Rearmament grants stacking reload speed on headshot.
On a weapon whose Incarnon form fires charge-backed rounds and never
reloads, does the buff do anything at all in that form — and does it
touch the gauge?

**Result (in-game, user, 2026-07-30):** the buff is **live in BOTH
forms**. What it does *not* affect is the **charge** — building the
Incarnon gauge is not a reload and takes no reload-speed scaling. It
**does** affect **transmute IN and transmute OUT**, consistent with M9's
finding that both directions scale with reload-speed bonuses.

**Consequence for the model.** A reload-speed source joins one bucket and
that bucket drives three things: magazine reloads, transmute-in and
transmute-out. Gauge fill is outside it — the only thing that shortens it
is a charge-rate evolution (Incarnon Efficiency). So on a weapon like the
Laetum, whose 216 charge-backed rounds mean the cycle is transmute-bound
rather than reload-bound, a reload buff still buys back real time. The
sim implements exactly this (`engine::dummy` rescales both transmute
animations by the live bucket); `charges_to_fill` is untouched.

---

## M11 — Is an "on hit" perk judged per trigger pull or per damage instance? ✅ (informal, 2026-07-30)

**Question.** Overwhelming Attrition reads "On Hit that is neither Critical
nor applies a Status Effect". Is that ONE evaluation per shot, or one per
damage instance the shot produces? The distinction decides what the perk is
worth on an AoE weapon, and it is the same question as whether a Laetum's
direct hit and its explosion each arm it.

**Result (in-game, user, 2026-07-30):** per **damage instance**, in both
directions the question could be asked.
1. **Across enemies:** fired into a crowd, a SINGLE Laetum shot takes the
   buff from empty to its 3-stack cap. One trigger pull cannot grant three
   stacks under a per-shot reading.
2. **On ONE enemy:** a single shot at a LONE target grants exactly **2
   stacks** — the direct hit and the explosion each arm it, and the count
   is the instance count, not the cap (3).

**Consequence for the model.** Result 2 is the load-bearing one and it is
direct, not inferred: two attack parts landing on the SAME enemy ARE two
instances. It also independently corroborates the verbatim AoE rules
(`Status_Effect`: each enemy hit gets its own status roll; Laetum: "Initial
hit and explosion apply status separately") from the perk side.

That is what `engine::dummy` implements — the trigger is evaluated inside the
attack-stage loop, so each stage judges its own crit and its own proc list.
Pinned by `the_explosion_arms_an_on_hit_buff_of_its_own`, which gives the
radial ZERO damage so the only thing it can contribute is the second arming.

**No residue.** Both readings are measured. Note the 2 (not 3) in result 2 is
itself informative: it rules out "any qualifying shot fills the buff" and
confirms the count tracks instances.

## M12 — Do overlapping lingering fields STACK on one target? (Torid) ✅ (2026-07-30)

**Answered: they STACK.** Full result — with two other field rules the same
session settled — in **M13** below. The protocol is kept because it records what
was at stake and why the branch is weapon DATA rather than a constant.

**Question.** A Torid grenade sticks to what it hits and leaves a 10 s cloud
ticking once a second. The magazine is 5 at 1.5 shots/s, so five clouds can be
attached to ONE enemy at once. Do they run as five concurrent tick streams, or
does a second grenade refresh a single field?

This is the last undocumented piece of the field model, and it is worth up to
**~5x sustained single-target DPS** — the whole reason to answer it before
implementing. The wiki says stacking clouds is effective (*"dealing large
amounts of damage if the player stacks multiple gas clouds"*, *"Stacking
multiple grenades on an ally allows them to run into groups of enemies"*) but
never says whether that means several streams on ONE enemy or just wider
coverage, and never quantifies it.

**Method** (Simulacrum, one target, unmodded Torid so the numbers are small
and readable):
1. Spawn a single high-EHP target that cannot die inside the test (a Steel Path
   Corrupted Bombard is convenient) and do NOT shoot it in the head — the cloud
   is 1x anyway, but keep the impact clean.
2. **One grenade.** Fire exactly one, then stop. Record the damage-number
   cadence for the full 10 s: expect ~10 ticks, one per second. Note the tick
   VALUE (it should be constant) and count the ticks.
3. **Two grenades, 1 s apart.** Fire, wait ~1 s, fire again. Then watch the
   window where both clouds are alive (seconds ~2–10).
   - **Stacking** ⇒ that window shows ~2 numbers per second, or one number of
     roughly double the value if the game merges simultaneous ticks.
   - **Refresh** ⇒ still ~1 number per second, and the total tick COUNT over
     the whole test is ~10–11, not ~20.
4. **Five grenades** emptied into the same target, then stop firing and count
   ticks until they stop. Stacking predicts ~50 ticks; refresh predicts ~10
   plus the tail. This is the discriminating trial — do it last, it is the one
   worth recording on video.
5. If they DO stack, also check whether the tick TIMERS are independent (ticks
   land at staggered sub-second offsets) or snap to a shared clock. That
   decides whether the sim schedules one timer per field or one shared one.

**Confounds to avoid.** No Toxin/Gas status mods — a Toxin PROC is its own DoT
and would be mistaken for a second tick stream. No multishot (each pellet is
its own grenade and its own cloud, which is the same question asked twice). Do
not stand in the cloud; self-damage is gone but stagger is not worth the noise.

**Outcome mapping.** Stacking ⇒ the field is a LIST of independent instances,
each with its own expiry, exactly like `DebuffState::dots`. Refresh ⇒ a single
field with a reset expiry, like the Heat singleton. The engine shape differs
enough that guessing wrong means rewriting it, which is why nothing is
implemented until this is answered.

## M13 — The lingering field's tick clock, stacking, and Renewed Horror ✅ (informal, 2026-07-30)

**Question.** Three things about the Torid's cloud that no source states, taken
together because one reading settles all three:
1. Does the first tick land WITH the impact, or one full period later?
2. Do overlapping clouds on ONE target run as N concurrent streams, or does a
   second grenade refresh a single field? (This is M12.)
3. Renewed Horror reads *"On Reload from Empty: Lingering damage field duration
   doubles on first shot"* — doubled duration, but how many extra TICKS?

**Result (in-game, user, 2026-07-30):**

1. **The first tick lands WITH the impact.** A hit shows the direct-hit number
   and the cloud's first number together, then nine more over the remaining nine
   seconds: **10 ticks per cloud, not 9.** The wiki's *"Clouds do not instantly
   do damage, so enemies that are quick may run through the cloud without taking
   any damage"* describes the grenade ARMING — reading it as a delayed tick clock
   cost a full tenth of the field's damage. The rule is the plain one:
   **ticks = duration × tick rate, the first at the moment of impact.**
2. **Renewed Horror doubles the NEXT shot's field, and only that one:** the
   post-reload shot reads **"1 direct hit + 20 pod ticks"** against the normal
   10. Note this corroborates result 1 without relying on it — a delayed first
   tick over a doubled 20 s lifetime would read 19.
3. **Overlapping fields STACK** — N concurrent tick streams, one per grenade.
   That answers M12, and it is what makes the cloud the weapon's main damage:
   a 5-round magazine can have all five attached at once.

**Consequence for the model.**

- `engine::dummy` schedules a fresh `FieldState` with `next_tick: t` (was
  `t + 1/tick_rate`) and `ticks_left = duration × tick_rate`. Pinned by
  `one_grenade_leaves_ten_ticks_starting_with_the_impact`.
- `FieldStacking` stays a two-branch DATA field on the weapon rather than
  collapsing to a constant — the Torid stacks, but the branch is per weapon and
  a future one may refresh. Both branches stay unit-tested.
- Renewed Horror stops being `unmodeled` and becomes a real effect kind,
  `field_duration_on_empty_reload: 2`, applied to the field spawned by the first
  shot after a reload from empty. On a 5-round magazine that is one cloud in five
  running 20 s instead of 10 — under `stack` semantics a straight +20% of the
  cloud's total ticks. Pinned by
  `renewed_horror_doubles_only_the_post_reload_field`.
- **Scoping note, not measured:** the sim arms the buff on the magazine-reload
  path only. Reverting out of the Incarnon form also refills the base magazine,
  but a form swap is not a "Reload from Empty", so it does not arm it. A
  modeling choice, recorded here rather than left silent.

Also worth recording: the perk was BROKEN once and fixed in 33.6 (*"Fixed
Torid's Renewed Horror perk not doubling duration on the damage field duration
on first shot as intended"*), so the doubling is live in the current build — the
measurement confirms it directly.

## M2 — Simulacrum "Steel Path" toggle: does it still boost armor?

**Question.** The toggle was introduced (U33.5) as "+250% Health, Armor,
and Shields", but U36 removed the armor bonus from Steel Path missions.
Does the Simulacrum toggle still touch armor?

**Sketch.** Armored target (e.g. Grineer Lancer) at a fixed level; compare
damage numbers of the same weapon with the toggle on/off; any change beyond
×(1/2.5) health scaling implies an armor change. (Only affects how we use
the Simulacrum as a lab — missions are authoritative for the engine.)

**Result:** _not yet run._
